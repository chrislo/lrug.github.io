# README.lrug

LRUG is a London-based community for anyone who is interested in the Ruby programming language, especially beginners.

LRUG provides [online](http://lrug.org/mailing-list) and [offline](http://lanyrd.com/series/lrug/) opportunities to:

 * discuss Ruby and related topics
 * socialise with friendly people who are interested in Ruby
 * find or fill Ruby-related jobs

We want LRUG to be a diverse and inclusive community, united by an interest in Ruby, and so we want anyone who is interested in Ruby to be able to participate.

## Code of Conduct

It’s of primary importance that everyone who wants to participate feels safe and welcome. When participating in LRUG, either online or offline, at Skills Matter or at the pub afterwards, we expect you to:

 * behave respectfully towards other people — they’re real humans, just like you
 * be considerate of people’s time and attention
 * contribute positively and constructively to discussions (online or in-person)

On the mailing list, we want to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio and while the organisers will step in as soon as they see poor behaviour, we encourage you to say something if you see it first.  So please:

 * lead by example — if a discussion is devolving into snark and name-calling, either let it die or raise the tone
 * keep standards high — if someone acts disrespectfully, make that crystal clear to them

### Incident Handling

LRUG is anti-harassment in all forms, and we're dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of our members in any form, including invasions of personal space and exclusionary jokes/comments. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any LRUG venue; not at the talks, not at the pub after the talks, or any other LRUG social meeting; not on Twitter or on any other online media. Please note that this list is non-exhaustive; if you make anyone feel uncomfortable or unwelcome, you will be asked to leave.

If you are not sure what we mean by harassment or exclusion, there are [several](https://us.pycon.org/2012/codeofconduct/) [good](http://theangryblackwoman.com/2009/10/01/the-dos-and-donts-of-being-a-good-ally/) [resources](http://www.shakesville.com/2010/01/feminism-101.html) [online](http://www.shakesville.com/2010/01/feminism-101.html) which we encourage you read. The main thing to remember though, is that if someone feels harassed or excluded by your words or actions, then those words or actions constitute harassment or exclusion. Your intent is *not* a factor.

All LRUG participants are accountable for their own behaviour. If you’ve behaved badly elsewhere, that may count against you here, because of the effect it has on other attendees.

If you experience or witness any harassing behaviour, please report it to:

 * [Aanand](http://aanandprasad.com/) ([@aanand](http://twitter.com/aanand), [aanand.prasad@gmail.com](mailto:aanand.prasad@gmail.com))
 * [Tom](http://codon.com/) ([@tomstuart](http://twitter.com/tomstuart), [tom@codon.com](mailto:tom@codon.com))

## Meetings

We meet once a month at [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96), usually on the second Monday. There are typically [two talks](#talks) and then we go to [the pub](#after-the-talks). There’s always tea and coffee at Skills Matter, and sometimes there’ll be pizza; beer is limited to the pub afterwards.

### Talks

Most of our meetings have talks from community members and we're always looking for people to give a talk. If you'd like to give a talk you should get in touch with [Murray Steele](http://h-lame.com/) ([@hlame](http://twitter.com/hlame), [murray.steele@lrug.org](mailto:murray.steele@lrug.org)) and suggest it.

Our goal is to accept any offered talk. If your talk is obviously about Ruby there's no question about it; you can definitely give your talk. If it's not so obviously about Ruby we'll have a discussion first to see what the hook is for Rubyists. We're quite an open-minded group, so the hook doesn't have to be that clear. In the unlikely event that it turns out that LRUG isn't a good home for your talk, we'll do our best to come up with some alternative ideas for places you could give it.

#### Scheduling

Slots for talks are first-come, first-served. Once you've decided to give your talk we'll let you know when a free slot will be available at a meeting. We usually have two talks per meeting, so if there are 4 people on our list of volunteers when you offer your talk it's most likely that the third meeting is the one we'd schedule you for. Of course, people drop out or aren't available for a specific meeting so you might get a slot sooner.

If there is a specific future meeting that would be most convenient for you, let us know and we'll do our best to accommodate that.

#### Content

LRUG is a mixed-ability crowd; we have talks from first-timers just learning Ruby all the way up to people that have been using it for years. This means you can pitch your talk at any level and someone will get something out of it. It's also a mostly technical crowd, so don't shy away from getting into the nitty gritty of your topic. We'd prefer an in-depth discussion of a single aspect to a shallow overview of the whole thing.

Your talk should observe the code of conduct. Any talks that don't will be stopped and the speaker asked to leave.

If you are using the projector you should favour large fonts and a high contrast colour scheme with dark text on a light background in anything you show. The default settings for most presentation applications are a safe bet, but you might have to re-configure your terminal or editor if you are using those.

#### Timing

Our normal pattern for a meeting is two speakers with 40 minute time slots, although one-off meetings might be different. For example, our February meetings are for lightning talks, run using the "20 slides, 20 seconds each" format.

A slot isn’t how long your talk should be, but how much time you will get in front of the group. You can fill that time slot as you see fit (talk + questions, talk only, &c).

For a 40-minute slot, we recommend a 30-minute talk. This leaves plenty of time for you to over-run, answer questions, and faff about with a laptop at the start.

### After The Talks

When the talks are finished, usually around 8pm, most of the group head over to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/). This part of the meeting is your opportunity to socialise with other LRUG members and speak with the presenters about their talks.

Just because we're in a pub doesn't mean you have to drink alcohol.  If you do choose to drink alcohol we encourage you to explore the food menu and drink responsibly.

Although the venue for this part of the meeting is a pub and therefore feels more informal, be aware that the code of conduct still applies.

## Sponsorship

LRUG is hosted by [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) who provide the venue; make tea, coffee, & water available during the talks; film the talks; and handle registration. We don't currently need venue sponsorship or an alternate venue.

There are opportunities for pizza or pizza and soft-drinks sponsorship during the meeting, or bar-tab sponsorship after the meeting at the pub. If you would like to provide sponsorship you should get in touch with: [Murray Steele](http://h-lame.com/) ([@hlame](http://twitter.com/hlame), [murray.steele@lrug.org](mailto:murray.steele@lrug.org)) to find out the prices and arrange it.

In return for your sponsorship LRUG will:

 1. put your logo in the sponsor side-bar on the relevant meeting page on [lrug.org](http://lrug.org)
 2. mention the specifics of your sponsorship in the main details of the relevant meeting page on [lrug.org](http://lrug.org)
 3. mention the sponsorship in the meeting announcement email on [the mailing list](http://lrug.org/mailing-list)
 4. tweet about the sponsorship from [@lrug](https://twitter.com/lrug) at least once to announce it and once on the day as a reminder
 5. mention you at the start of the meeting, and make sure you have 30seconds or so during our announcements section to talk to the group
